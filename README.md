Simple Messaging for Growers

Farm's customers seem to respond most favorably to person-to-person emails, or emails sent BCC
from the farmer's direct personal account. The rich emails/newsletters from MailChimp and
ConstantContact are pretty, but they don't engage customers as well. They look professional,
but there's lots of evidence that a professional look isn't what growers' customers are
looking for.

supyall is a simple messaging program that will, allow growers to:

* Send direct, plain-text messages to their customers over email and text
* Manage email and phone contacts
* (Later) allow direct ordering over email or text via (via GreenMaven inventory integration)
